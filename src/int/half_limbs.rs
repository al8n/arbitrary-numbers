//! The two primitives of `limb_layer!` for a limb type with no native integer of twice its width.
//!
//! A limb of `B` bits is split into two digits of `H = B / 2` bits, each held in the limb type, so
//! that every product of two digits and every quotient by a digit is an operation of the limb type.
//! `limbs128` uses it for `u128`; the tests instantiate it for `u8` to `u64` and check it against
//! native integers of twice the width.

/// Defines, in the module that invokes it, the primitives `carrying_mul_add` and `div_rem_wide` of
/// `limb_layer!` for limbs of type `$limb`, with the contracts that `limb_layer!` states, and the
/// constants and the division step that they use.
// The items name `$limb`, never `Limb`, which `limb_layer!` defines in the same module.
