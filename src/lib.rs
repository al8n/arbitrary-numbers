//! Exact fixed-point decimal numbers whose digit counts are part of the type.
//!
//! [`Decimal<Integral, Fraction, Repr>`](Decimal) stores the value `c / 10^Fraction` as an integer
//! coefficient `c` of type `Repr`, with `|c| <= 10^(Integral + Fraction) - 1`. The digit counts
//! are [`typenum`] numbers, so capacity is checked during type checking: no value can be created
//! for a type with more than 154 digits or with a `Repr` that cannot hold its digits. `Repr`
//! defaults to the smallest signed integer that holds the digits, up to 153 digits; an unsigned
//! `Repr`, such as `u64` for up to 19 digits, gives a type whose values are never negative.
//!
//! ```
//! use numo::{
//!   Decimal,
//!   typenum::{U8, U10, U12},
//! };
//!
//! type Price = Decimal<U10, U8>; // 18 digits, stored in an `i64`
//! type Quantity = Decimal<U12, U8>; // 20 digits, stored in an `i128`
//!
//! let price: Price = "64250.5".parse()?;
//! let quantity: Quantity = "0.0015".parse()?;
//!
//! // The product type, `Decimal<U22, U16>`, is computed by the compiler; nothing is rounded.
//! let notional = price.exact_mul(quantity);
//! assert_eq!(notional.to_string(), "96.37575");
//!
//! // Sums are checked against the decimal range, not only the storage range.
//! assert_eq!(Price::MAX.checked_add(price), None);
//! # Ok::<(), numo::ParseError>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Every operation is exact: it returns the exact result or reports failure, and nothing rounds,
//! truncates or wraps unless asked to. Rounding takes an explicit [`RoundingMode`]:
//! [`round_to`](Decimal::round_to) converts to fewer fraction digits,
//! [`quantize`](Decimal::quantize) rounds to a multiple of a step and
//! [`div_round`](Decimal::div_round) divides into any decimal type, while
//! [`is_multiple_of`](Decimal::is_multiple_of) checks a value against a step without rounding it.
//! Parsing accepts decimal and exponent notation with `_` separators, including every form that
//! `f64` parses, and rejects infinity, NaN and digits that do not fit; formatting writes the
//! shortest exact text. See [`Decimal`] for the details.
//!
//! # Wide storage
//!
//! Up to 38 digits, `Repr` is a native integer. Beyond that, up to 153 digits, it is one of the
//! wide integers of this crate, aliases of [`Uint`] and [`Int`] that store 64-bit limbs: the signed
//! [`i192`], [`i256`], [`i320`], [`i384`], [`i448`] and [`i512`] hold 57, 76, 96, 115, 134 and 153
//! digits, and the unsigned [`u192`], [`u256`], [`u320`], [`u384`], [`u448`] and [`u512`] hold 57,
//! 77, 96, 115, 134 and 154. So any uint256 amount, which has at most 78 digits, fits a `u320`. The
//! 154th digit is available only with an explicit `u512`, as in `Decimal<U154, U0, u512>`; the
//! default storage and the product of [`exact_mul`](Decimal::exact_mul) stop at 153 digits, and a
//! product with more digits fails to compile.
//!
//! A wide coefficient is built from its limbs, least significant first, and
//! [`from_repr`](Decimal::from_repr) returns `None` when it is out of range. Parsing decimal text
//! with an exponent gives the same value:
//!
//! ```
//! use numo::{
//!   Decimal,
//!   typenum::{U18, U60},
//!   u320,
//! };
//!
//! // Any uint256 amount of a token with 18 decimals.
//! type TokenAmount = Decimal<U60, U18, u320>;
//!
//! // The raw amount 2^64 + 5 as the four limbs of a uint256, with a fifth limb of zero.
//! let raw: [u64; 4] = [5, 1, 0, 0];
//! let [l0, l1, l2, l3] = raw;
//! let amount = TokenAmount::from_repr(u320::from_limbs([l0, l1, l2, l3, 0])).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(amount.to_string(), "18.446744073709551621");
//! assert_eq!("18446744073709551621e-18".parse::<TokenAmount>()?, amount);
//! # Ok::<(), numo::ParseError>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Integers
//!
//! [`Uint<Bits, Repr>`](Uint) and [`Int<Bits, Repr>`](Int) are integers of `Bits` bits, unsigned
//! and in two's complement, stored in an array of limbs, least significant first, that holds at
//! least `Bits` bits: `[u64; N]`, `[u32; N]`, `[u16; N]` or `[u8; N]`. `[u64; N]` is the fastest
//! storage on 64-bit targets, `[u32; N]` suits 32-bit targets, and `[u8; N]` has alignment 1 and
//! holds the little-endian bytes of the value on every target. The module [`aliases`] names the
//! widths of the wide storages above and 768, 1024, 2048 and 4096 bits in 64-bit limbs, each of
//! which fills its limbs; any other width or limb type is written out, such as
//! `Uint<U200, [u64; 4]>` or `Uint<U24, [u8; 3]>`. [`FitsBits`] relates a width to the storages
//! that hold it, and [`FillsRepr`] to the storages that it fills.
//!
//! Each type has the constants `BITS`, `ZERO`, `MIN` and `MAX`. Its `const fn` constructors are
//! `from_limbs`, for a width that fills its limbs, and `checked_from_limbs`, which checks that the
//! limbs hold a value of `Bits` bits; its `const fn` methods are `to_limbs`, `as_limbs` and
//! `is_zero`, and for `Int` also `is_negative` and `is_positive`. Values compare, hash and format
//! by their numeric value, alike in every storage. There is no integer arithmetic yet.
//!
//! ```
//! use numo::{
//!   Int, Uint, i256,
//!   typenum::{U7, U24, U200},
//! };
//!
//! // A width that fills its limbs takes any bit pattern: -1 has every bit set.
//! let minus_one = i256::from_limbs([u64::MAX; 4]);
//! assert!(minus_one.is_negative() && i256::MIN < minus_one);
//!
//! // Another width checks the limbs.
//! type U200x4 = Uint<U200, [u64; 4]>;
//! assert_eq!(U200x4::MAX.to_limbs(), [u64::MAX, u64::MAX, u64::MAX, 0xff]);
//! assert_eq!(U200x4::checked_from_limbs([0, 0, 0, 0x100]), None);
//! assert_eq!(Int::<U7, [u64; 1]>::MIN.to_string(), "-64");
//!
//! // Three bytes, least significant first, hold the same value as one 64-bit limb.
//! let bytes = Uint::<U24, [u8; 3]>::from_limbs([1, 2, 3]);
//! let word = Uint::<U24, [u64; 1]>::checked_from_limbs([0x03_02_01]).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(bytes.to_string(), word.to_string());
//! ```
//!
//! # `typenum`
//!
//! The crate re-exports [`typenum`], so no direct dependency is needed. Digit counts are written
//! as its constants, such as `typenum::U8`, or as `typenum::U<8>`. The constants are not
//! re-exported at the crate root, which keeps the root namespace to this crate's own items.
//!
//! # `no_std`
//!
//! The crate is `no_std` and never allocates, except for the boxed iterator that the `quickcheck`
//! feature returns from shrinking, as the `quickcheck` trait requires.
//!
//! # `serde`
//!
//! The `serde` feature implements `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for [`Decimal`] and
//! [`RoundingMode`]. The impls are written against `serde_core`, whose traits `serde` re-exports
//! from version 1.0.220 on, so they need a build whose `serde` is 1.0.220 or later; an older
//! `serde` defines traits of its own. The feature enables `serde_core` without its default
//! features and nothing else, so it turns on no feature in any other crate of a build, and it
//! needs no allocation.
//!
//! A decimal is written as a string, the text that `Display` writes, and read from a string in the
//! syntax of [`parse`](Decimal::parse), in every format, human-readable or binary. Reading
//! rejects a number, so a decimal never passes through a binary floating-point value, which would
//! change `16.7` to the nearest `f64`. Nor is the coefficient written alone: it depends on the
//! number of fraction digits, and read back into a type with another number it would be off by a
//! power of ten. A rounding mode is written as the name of its variant, such as `"HalfEven"`.
//!
//! # `arbitrary`, `proptest` and `quickcheck`
//!
//! The `arbitrary`, `proptest` and `quickcheck` features implement the `Arbitrary` trait of each
//! crate for [`Decimal`] and [`RoundingMode`], for fuzzing and property tests. All three draw a
//! decimal the same way. With probability 1/8 it is an edge value: zero, one unit in the last
//! place, one when `Integral` is nonzero, `MAX`, or a coefficient of `10^k`, `10^k - 1`, `5 * 10^k`
//! or `15 * 10^k` for a uniform `k`, the last two being rounding ties. Otherwise the number of
//! digits of its coefficient is uniform between one and `Integral + Fraction`, and the coefficient
//! is uniform among the numbers with that many digits, so small amounts, values with few fraction
//! digits and values of full width are all common. With probability 1/4, a uniform number of its
//! trailing digits, fewer than all of them, is then zero, which makes values on a coarser step,
//! such as `64250.50`, frequent. A signed storage gives a nonzero value either sign with equal
//! probability.
//!
//! The `arbitrary` feature reads one byte for each choice through `Unstructured::int_in_range`,
//! which makes the choices only nearly uniform. As for `arbitrary` itself, which bytes give which
//! value is not stable and may change in any release.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "arbitrary")]
//! # {
//! use arbitrary::{Arbitrary, Unstructured};
//! use numo::{
//!   Decimal,
//!   typenum::{U8, U10},
//! };
//!
//! type Price = Decimal<U10, U8>;
//!
//! // Bytes from a fuzzer.
//! let bytes = [3, 17, 4, 2, 9, 9, 1, 3, 5, 8, 0, 6];
//! let price = Price::arbitrary(&mut Unstructured::new(&bytes)).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(price.to_string().parse(), Ok(price));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The `proptest` and `quickcheck` features shrink a failing decimal by decimal truncation: they
//! try zero, then the magnitude of a negative value, then the value truncated toward zero to its
//! first digit, its first two digits, and so on, and continue from the first candidate that fails.
//! They stop at a failing value none of whose candidates fail, which is not necessarily the
//! smallest failing value. A rounding mode shrinks toward [`RoundingMode::Down`], which truncates.
//! The `proptest` feature enables the `std` feature of `proptest` and adds the module
//! `numo::proptest`, with the strategy and value tree of a decimal.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "proptest")]
//! # {
//! use numo::{
//!   Decimal, RoundingMode,
//!   typenum::{U8, U10},
//! };
//! use proptest::prelude::*;
//!
//! type Price = Decimal<U10, U8>;
//!
//! proptest!(|(price in any::<Price>(), mode in any::<RoundingMode>())| {
//!   let tick: Price = "0.01".parse().unwrap();
//!   if let Ok(rounded) = price.quantize(tick, mode) {
//!     prop_assert!(rounded.is_multiple_of(tick));
//!   }
//! });
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The `quickcheck` feature boxes the iterator that shrinking returns, as the `quickcheck` trait
//! requires.
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(feature = "quickcheck")]
//! # {
//! use numo::{
//!   Decimal,
//!   typenum::{U8, U10},
//! };
//! use quickcheck::QuickCheck;
//!
//! type Price = Decimal<U10, U8>;
//!
//! fn cancels(price: Price) -> bool {
//!   price.checked_add(-price) == Some(Price::ZERO)
//! }
//!
//! QuickCheck::new().quickcheck(cancels as fn(Price) -> bool);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The three frameworks use `std`, so these features need a target that has it; the code of this
//! crate stays `no_std`.
